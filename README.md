# NOTE
This is a modified version of the stable branch to support new features until version 13 is released and stable. 
I've added and removed certain stuff from it. As it's either not really used in my projects or just a simple getter that can easily be added on the dev's side. 

### **Removed**
`messageEditHistoryMaxSize` and message edit history 

`lastMessageID`, `lastPinTimestamp`, `lastMessageChannelID` `lastMessage`, `lastPinTimestamp` fields

`GuildEmoji#deletable` and `GuildEmoji#setName`

`GuildMember#partial`, `GuildMember#kickable`, `GuildMember#bannable`, `GuildMember#setNickname`, `GuildMember#hasPermission` (it's been deprecated for ages now)

`Invite#deletable`

`Message#pinnable`, `Message#crosspostable`

`Role#setName`, `Role#setHoist`, `Role#setPosition` and `Role#setMentionable`

`TextChannel#setRateLimitPerUser`, `TextChannel#setNSFW`, `TextChannel#typingIn`, `TextChannel#typingSinceIn`, `TextChannel#typingDurationIn`

`VoiceChannel#setUserLimit`

`VoiceState#setMute`, `VoiceState#setDeaf`, `VoiceState#setSelfDeaf` and `VoiceState#setSelfMute`

`WebhookClient#sendSlackMessage` (who tf uses that)

### **Updated**:
`MessageEmbed#setTitle` now accepts the url aswell `setTitle(text, url)`

## WARNING
I'm not responsible for what happens to your application if you decide to use this repo. 
This will most likely be archived once discord.js version 13 comes out fully and has been stable for awhile.  


## About

discord.js is a powerful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily interact with the
[Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

- Object-oriented
- Predictable abstractions
- Performant
- 100% coverage of the Discord API

## Installation

**Node.js 12.0.0 or newer is required.**  
Ignore any warnings about unmet peer dependencies, as they're all optional.

Without voice support: `npm install discord.js`  
With voice support ([@discordjs/opus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/opus)): `npm install discord.js @discordjs/opus`  
With voice support ([opusscript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opusscript)): `npm install discord.js opusscript`

### Audio engines

The preferred audio engine is @discordjs/opus, as it performs significantly better than opusscript. When both are available, discord.js will automatically choose @discordjs/opus.
Using opusscript is only recommended for development environments where @discordjs/opus is tough to get working.
For production bots, using @discordjs/opus should be considered a necessity, especially if they're going to be running on multiple servers.

### Optional packages

- [zlib-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zlib-sync) for WebSocket data compression and inflation (`npm install zlib-sync`)
- [erlpack](https://github.com/discord/erlpack) for significantly faster WebSocket data (de)serialisation (`npm install discord/erlpack`)
- One of the following packages can be installed for faster voice packet encryption and decryption:
  - [sodium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodium) (`npm install sodium`)
  - [libsodium.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libsodium-wrappers) (`npm install libsodium-wrappers`)
- [bufferutil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bufferutil) for a much faster WebSocket connection (`npm install bufferutil`)
- [utf-8-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/utf-8-validate) in combination with `bufferutil` for much faster WebSocket processing (`npm install utf-8-validate`)

## Example usage

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();

client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);
});

client.on('message', msg => {
  if (msg.content === 'ping') {
    msg.reply('pong');
  }
});

client.login('token');
```
